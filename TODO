1. read fasta file as a stream

2. get the first sequence in a Dict (how much memory is required?)

3. get the length of the dict

4. generate x integers between 0 and seq_length, put in an array X  (how much memory is required?)

5. select and print the positions in sequence based on positions in X

6. read in the next sequence

7.  GOTO 5.
