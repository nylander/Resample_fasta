# Resample FASTA alignments

## Description

Sample random columns from a set of aligned fasta formatted sequences.
That is, sample positions in one sequence, then make sure to sample the same
potitions in all consequtive seuences as well.

On approach that seems fit is ["reservoire sampling"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling): 

>Reservoir sampling is a family of randomized algorithms for randomly choosing k 
>samples from a list of n items, where n is either a very large or unknown 
>number. Typically n is large enough that the list doesnâ€™t fit into main 
>memory.

Another approach might be the ["inside-out version of the Fisher-Yates shuffle"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling#Relation_to_Fisher-Yates_shuffle):

## Some code

    char* array[19];
    #define ARR_SIZE(arr) ( sizeof((arr)) / sizeof((arr[0])) )
    arr[rand() % ARR_SIZE(arr)]

    int n = rand()%20; // But, "% 20 can yield non-uniform results"
    printf("%s\n", array[n]);



    // Returns an array containing x unique random ints between min and max. (caller must free).
    // Works by generating x sequential random integers in the range, then 
    // shuffling them. Add a seed(time) somewhere in caller if you don't want the same 
    // results every run.

    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <stdint.h>
    #define MAX_ALLOC ((uint32_t)0x40000000)  //max allocated bytes, fix per platform
    #define MAX_SAMPLES (MAX_ALLOC/sizeof(uint32_t))

    int* randsamp(uint32_t x, uint32_t min, uint32_t max)
    {
       uint32_t r,i=x,*a;
       if (!x||x>MAX_SAMPLES||x>(max-min+1)) return NULL;
       a=malloc(x*sizeof(uint32_t));
       while (i--) {
          r= (max-min+1-i);
          a[i]=min+=(r ? rand()%r : 0);
          min++;
       }
       while (x>1) {
          r=a[i=rand()%x--];
          a[i]=a[x];
          a[x]=r;
       }
       return a;
    }
