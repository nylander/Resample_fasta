# Resample FASTA alignments

## Description

Sample random columns from a set of aligned fasta formatted sequences.
That is, sample positions in one sequence, then make sure to sample the same
potitions in all consequtive seuences as well.

Note: Reservoir sampling doesn't seem to fit well for several sequences if sequence file is read as a stream.
Try to look at hashes instead:

Note: `RAND_MAX`, The value of this macro is an integer constant representing the largest value the rand function can return. In the GNU C Library, it is 2147483647, which is the largest signed integer representable in 32 bits. [source](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/ISO-Random.html)




On approach that seems fit is ["reservoire sampling"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling): 

>Reservoir sampling is a family of randomized algorithms for randomly choosing k 
>samples from a list of n items, where n is either a very large or unknown 
>number. Typically n is large enough that the list doesnâ€™t fit into main 
>memory.

Another approach might be the ["inside-out version of the Fisher-Yates shuffle"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling#Relation_to_Fisher-Yates_shuffle):

## Some code

To print line breaks after some length, use an iterator (i), and use the modulo operator:

    for (i=0; i<1000; i++) {
        printf("%20llu ", genrand64_int64());
        if (i%5==4) printf("\n");
    }





    int main(void)
    {
        int i;
        unsigned long long init[4]={0x12345ULL, 0x23456ULL, 0x34567ULL, 0x45678ULL}, length=4;
        init_by_array64(init, length);
        printf("1000 outputs of genrand64_int64()\n");
        for (i=0; i<1000; i++) {
          printf("%20llu ", genrand64_int64());
          if (i%5==4) printf("\n");
        }
        printf("\n1000 outputs of genrand64_real2()\n");
        for (i=0; i<1000; i++) {
          printf("%10.8f ", genrand64_real2());
          if (i%5==4) printf("\n");
        }
        return 0;
    }
